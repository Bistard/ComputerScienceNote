# Introduction - SOLID Principles

SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. 

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: 

1. Single Responsibility Principle

    > An active corollary to Conway’s law: The best structure for a software system is heavily influenced by the social structure of the organization that uses it so that each software module should be responsible to one, and only one, reason to change.

2. Open-Closed Principle

    > Bertrand Meyer made this principle famous in the 1980s. The gist is that for software systems to be easy to change, they must be designed to allow the behavior of those systems to be changed by adding new code, rather than changing existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle

    > Barbara Liskov’s famous definition of subtypes, from 1988. In short, this principle says that to build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be subsitituted one for another.

4. Interface Segregation Principle

    > This principle advises software designers to avoid depending on things that they don’t use.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle

    > The code that implements high-level policy should not depend on the code that implements low-level details. Rather, details should depend on policies.

All five are commonly used by software engineers and provide some important benefits for developers.
