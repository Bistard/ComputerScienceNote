# 一等对象 - First-class Object

> <u>In short, it means there are no restrictions on the object's use</u>. It's the same as any other object.

A first class object is **an entity that can be dynamically created, destroyed, passed to a function, returned as a value, and have all the rights as other variables in the programming language have**. 

* Depending on the language, this can imply: 

    * being expressible as an anonymous literal value. 
    * being storable in variables. 
    * being storable in data structures
    * having an intrinsic identity (independent of any given name)
    * being comparable for equality with other entities
    * being passable as a parameter to a procedure/function
    * being returnable as the result of a procedure/function
    * being constructible at runtime
    * being printable
    * being readable
    * being transmissible among distributed processes
    * being storable outside running processes

    > 譬如在C语言中，函数就不是一等对象，而是二等对象（Second-class Object）。而在JavaScript中的函数则是一等对象。
