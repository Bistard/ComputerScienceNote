# Test Organization
As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex discipline, and different people use different terminology and organization. The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration tests.
* **Unit tests** are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces.
* **Integration tests** are entirely external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test.

Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.

# Unit Tests
The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as expected. You’ll put unit tests in the `src` directory in each file with the code that they’re testing. The convention is to create a module named `tests` in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with `cfg(test)`.

## The Tests Module and `#[cfg(test)]`
The `#[cfg(test)]` annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run the test code only when you run `cargo test`, not when you run `cargo build`.
> This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included.
> You’ll see that because integration tests go in a different directory. However, because unit tests go in the same files as the code, you’ll use `#[cfg(test)]` to specify that they shouldn’t be included in the compiled result.

## Testing Private Functions
> There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.

Regardless of which testing ideology you adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.
```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*; // makes able to access `internal_adder`

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
```

# Integration Tests
In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration tests, you first need a `tests` directory.

## The `tests` Directory
We create a `tests` directory at the top level of our project directory, next to `src`. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the files as an individual crate.

Let’s create an integration test:
```txt
adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs
```
```rust
// tests/integration_test.rs
use adder;
#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
```
* Each file in the tests directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our library into each test crate’s scope. For that reason we add `use adder` at the top of the code, which we didn’t need in the unit tests.
* We don’t need to annotate any code in `tests/integration_test.rs` with `#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo treats the `tests` directory specially and compiles files in this directory only when we run cargo test.

We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test function’s name as an argument to `cargo test`. To run a particular integration test file, use the `--test argument of cargo test`:
```bash
$ cargo test --test your_integration_test_file_name
```

## Submodules in Integration Tests
As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the `tests` directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test functions by the functionality they’re testing.

For example, if we create `tests/common.rs` and place a function named `setup` in it, we can add some code to `setup` that we want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:
```rust
// src/tests/common.rs
pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}
```
* When we run the tests again, we’ll see a new section in the test output for the `common.rs` file, even though this file doesn’t contain any test functions nor did we call the setup function from anywhere.

To avoid having common appear in the test output, instead of creating `tests/common.rs`, we’ll create `tests/common/mod.rs`. The project directory now looks like this:
```txt
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── common
    │   └── mod.rs
    └── integration_test.rs
```
* Files in subdirectories of the `tests` directory don’t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test output.

# Integration Tests for Binary Crates
If our project is a binary crate that only contains a `src/main.rs` file and doesn’t have a `src/lib.rs` file, we can’t create integration tests in the tests directory and bring functions defined in the `src/main.rs` file into scope with a `use` statement.

Only library crates expose functions that other crates can use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.

> This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a straightforward `src/main.rs` file that calls logic that lives in the `src/lib.rs` file. Using that structure, integration tests can test the library crate with `use` to make the important functionality available. If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the `src/main.rs` file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t need to be tested.

# Summary
Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit tests exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.
