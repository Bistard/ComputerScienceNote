# Closures: Anonymous Functions that Capture Their Environment
Rust’s closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. 
> Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re defined. We’ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior customization.

For example, a closure that captures the `x` variable:
```rust
|val| val + x
```
Other characteristics of closures include:
* using `||` instead of `()` around input variables.
* optional body delimination (`{}`) for a single expression (mandatory otherwise).
* the ability to capture the outer environment variables.

The following is a simple example of closures that does not capture any environment variables:
```rust
fn main() {
    // Increment via closures and functions.
    fn function(i: i32) -> i32 { i + 1 }

    // Closures are anonymous, here we are binding them to references
    // Annotation is identical to function annotation but is optional
    // as are the `{}` wrapping the body. These nameless functions
    // are assigned to appropriately named variables.
    let closure_annotated = |i: i32| -> i32 { i + 1 };
    let closure_inferred  = |i     |          i + 1  ;

    let i = 1;
    // Call the function and closures.
    println!("function: {}", function(i));
    println!("closure_annotated: {}", closure_annotated(i));
    println!("closure_inferred: {}", closure_inferred(i));
    // Once closure's type has been inferred, it cannot be inferred again with another type.
    //println!("cannot reuse closure_inferred with another type: {}", closure_inferred(42i64));
    // TODO: uncomment the line above and see the compiler error.

    // A closure taking no arguments which returns an `i32`.
    // The return type is inferred.
    let one = || 1;
    println!("closure returning one: {}", one());
}
```

# Capturing the Environment with Closures
Closures are inherently flexible and will do what the functionality requires to make the closure work without annotation. This allows capturing to flexibly adapt to the use case, sometimes moving and sometimes borrowing. Closures can capture variables:
* by reference: `&T`
* by mutable reference: `&mut T`
* by value: `T`

## Capture Values by Immutable Reference
Here is an example that creates a closure that captures value by immutable reference:
```rust
let color = String::from("green");

// A closure to print `color` which immediately borrows (`&`) `color` and
// stores the borrow and closure in the `print` variable. It will remain
// borrowed until `print` is used the last time. 
//
// `println!` only requires arguments by immutable reference so it doesn't
// impose anything more restrictive.
let print = || println!("`color`: {}", color);

// Call the closure using the borrow.
print();

// `color` can be borrowed immutably again, because the closure only holds
// an immutable reference to `color`. 
let _reborrow = &color;
print();

// A move or reborrow is allowed after the final use of `print`
let _color_moved = color;
```

## Capture Values by Mutable Reference
The following is an example that creates a closure that captures value by mutable reference:
```rust
let mut count = 0;
// A closure to increment `count` could take either `&mut count` or `count`
// but `&mut count` is less restrictive so it takes that. Immediately
// borrows `count`.
//
// A `mut` is required on `inc` because a `&mut` is stored inside. Thus,
// calling the closure mutates the closure which requires a `mut`.
let mut inc = || {
    count += 1;
};

// Call the closure using a mutable borrow.
inc();

// The closure still mutably borrows `count` because it is called later.
// An attempt to reborrow will lead to an error.
// let _reborrow = &count; 
// ^ TODO: try uncommenting this line.
inc();

// The closure no longer needs to borrow `&mut count`. Therefore, it is
// possible to reborrow without an error
let _count_reborrowed = &mut count; 
```

## Capture Values by Moving
Here is an example that creates a closure that captures value by moving into the closure:
```rust
use std::mem;

// A non-copy type.
let movable = Box::new(3);

// `mem::drop` requires `T` so this must take by value. A copy type
// would copy into the closure leaving the original untouched.
// A non-copy must move and so `movable` immediately moves into
// the closure.
let consume = || {
    mem::drop(movable);
};

// `consume` consumes the variable so this can only be called once.
consume();
// consume();
// ^ TODO: Try uncommenting this line.
```
