# References and Borrowing
A *reference* is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. **Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.**

Here is an example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`. These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it:

> Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is *dereferencing*, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We’ll see some uses of the dereference operator in later chapters.

Let’s take a closer look at the function:
```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
```
The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped when `s` stops being used, because `s` doesn’t have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

> We call the action of creating a reference **borrowing**. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back. You don’t own it.

## Try to Modify When Borrowing
So, what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Try the following code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
Here’s the error:
```bash
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*some_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
 --> src/main.rs:8:5
  |
7 | fn change(some_string: &String) {
  |                        ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut String`
8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `some_string` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
```
**Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references**. We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

## Mutable References
We can fix the code from above to allow us to modify a borrowed value, it is called a *mutable reference*:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
First we change `s` to be `mut`. Then we create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows.

> Mutable references have one big restriction: **if you have a mutable reference to a value, you cannot have other references to that value**.

This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // ❌ WONT'T COMPILE

println!("The value of r1 and r2 are: {}, {}", r1, r2);
```
This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in `r1` and must last until it’s used in the `println!`, but between the creation of that mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference in `r2` that borrows the same data as `r1`.

### Data Races
> The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s something that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages let you mutate whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent *data races* at compile time.

A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:
* Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
* At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
* There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

> ⚠Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!

> **Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used.**

The above code can be fix by:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    println!("the value of r1 is: {}", r1);

    let r2 = &mut s;
    println!("the value of r2 is: {}", r2);
}
```
Or by using curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not *simultaneous* ones:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;
```

### Combining Mutable and Immutable References
Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // ❌ WON'T COMPILE

println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```
We **also cannot** have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.

Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the value to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no one is reading data to cause potential data races.

The above code can be fixed by:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
// variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
println!("{}", r3);
```

> Ideas: Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don’t have to track down why your data isn’t what you thought it was.

## Dangling References
In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer—a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else—by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.
