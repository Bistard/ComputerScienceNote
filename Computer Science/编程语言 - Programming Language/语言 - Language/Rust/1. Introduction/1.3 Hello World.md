# Hello, World!
Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program. It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text `Hello, world!` to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!

# Creating a Project Directory
For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:
```bash
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```
For Windows CMD, enter this:
```bash
> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> mkdir hello_world
> cd hello_world
```

# Writing and Running a Rust Program
Next, make a new source file and call it main.rs. Rust files always end with the `.rs` extension.

Now open the `main.rs` file you just created and enter the code.
```rust
// Filename: main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the ~/projects/hello_world directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile and run the file `./main`:
```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```
On Windows, enter the command `.\main.exe` instead of `./main`:
```bash
> rustc main.rs
> .\main.exe
Hello, world!
```
If `Hello, world!` did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust program. That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!
