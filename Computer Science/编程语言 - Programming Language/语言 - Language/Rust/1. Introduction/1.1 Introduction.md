# Introduction
Rust has a steep learning curve in the very beginning. It is great to summarize your knowledge during the learning process and that is why I started the brand new notebook section for Rust.

For the most content of the fundamental techniques of the language will mainly be copied directly from the [offical Rust book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book). Unlike the original book, partial content might be truncated due to the neatness purpose. My own techniques and tips will also be included.
