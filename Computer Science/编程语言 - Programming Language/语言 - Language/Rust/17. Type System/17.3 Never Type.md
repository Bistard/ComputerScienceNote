# The Never Type that Never Returns

Rust has a special type named `!` that’s known in type theory lingo as the *empty type* because it has no values. We prefer to call it the ***never type*** because it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never return.

```rust
fn bar() -> ! {
    panic!();
}
```

* This code is read as “the function `bar` returns never.” Functions that return never are called *diverging functions*. We can’t create values of the type `!` so `bar` can never possibly return.

> ```rust
> fn main() {
>     let guess = "3";
>     let guess = match guess.trim().parse() { // ❌ WON'T COMPILE
>         Ok(_) => 5,
>         Err(_) => "hello",
>     };

> We discussed that `match` arms must all return the same type. Thus the above code cannot compile. As you might have guessed, `continue` has a `!` value.

> One final expression that has the type `!` is a `loop`:

> ```rust
> fn main() {
>     print!("forever ");
>     loop {
>         print!("and ever ");
>     }
> }
> ```

> Here, the loop never ends, so `!` is the value of the expression. However, this wouldn’t be true if we included a `break`, because the loop would terminate when it got to the `break`.
