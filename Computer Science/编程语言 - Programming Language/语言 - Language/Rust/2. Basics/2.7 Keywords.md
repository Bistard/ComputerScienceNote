# Raw Identifiers

***Raw identifiers*** are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t normally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#`.

```rust
fn r#match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

fn main() {
    assert!(r#match("foo", "foobar"));
}
```

* This code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function name in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main`.

> Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if that word happens to be a reserved keyword. 
>
> This gives us more freedom to choose identifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a language where these words aren’t keywords.
