# Operator Overloading

Rust doesnâ€™t allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary operators. But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed in `std::ops` by implementing the traits associated with the operator.



For example, we overload the `+` operator to add two `Point` instances together. We do this by implementing the `Add` trait on a `Point` struct:

```rust
use std::ops::Add;

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;
    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        Point { x: 1, y: 0 } + Point { x: 2, y: 3 },
        Point { x: 3, y: 3 }
    );
}
```

* The `add` method adds the `x` values of two `Point` instances and the `y` values of two `Point` instances to create a new `Point`.
* The `Add` trait has an associated type named `Output` that determines the type returned from the `add` method.

> The default generic type in this code is within the `Add` trait. Here is its definition:
>
> ```rust
> trait Add<Rhs=Self> {
>     type Output;
>     fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
> }
> ```
