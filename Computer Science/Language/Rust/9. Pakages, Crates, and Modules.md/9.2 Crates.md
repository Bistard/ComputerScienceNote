# Crates
A **crate** is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time. **When passing a single source code file to `rustc` (or `Cargo`), the compiler will consider that file to be a crate**.
> rates can contain *modules*, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections.

A crate can come in one of two forms: 
* a binary crate,
* a library crate.

## Binary Crates
*Binary crates* are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, such as a command-line program or a server. Each must have a function called `main` that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we’ve created so far have been binary crates.

## Library Crates
*Library crates* don’t have a `main` function, and they don’t compile to an executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.

> Most of the time when Rustaceans say “crate”, they mean library crate, and they use “crate” interchangeably with the general programming concept of a “library".

## Crate Root
The *crate root* is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the “Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy” section).
