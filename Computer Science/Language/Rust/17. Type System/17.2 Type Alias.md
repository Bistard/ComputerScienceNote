# Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases

Rust provides the ability to declare a *type alias* to give an existing type another name. For this we use the `type` keyword:

```rust
fn main() {
    type Kilometers = i32;
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: Kilometers = 5;
    println!("x + y = {}", x + y);
}
```

* `Kilometers` is not a separate, new type. Values that have the type `Kilometers` will be treated the same as values of type `i32`.
* However, using this method, we donâ€™t get the type checking benefits that we get from the newtype pattern discussed earlier.

The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we might have a lengthy type like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    type Thunk = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>;

    let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!("hi"));

    fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {
        // --snip--
    }

    fn returns_long_type() -> Thunk {
        // --snip--
        Box::new(|| ())
    }
}
```
