# Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction
> The [earlier section](..\8. Generic Types\8.2 Traits\8.2.6 Newtype Pattern.md) has already talked about a concrete example of the usage of newtype pattern for traits.

* The newtype pattern is also useful when statically enforcing that values are never confused and indicating the units of a value.
* We can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation details of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is different from the API of the private inner type.
* Newtypes can also hide internal implementation as the eariler section already illustrated.
