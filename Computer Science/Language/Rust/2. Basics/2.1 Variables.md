# Variables
Yes, it is called variable but by default, variables are **immutable**.
> This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value:
```rust
// src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6; // ❌ WON'T COMPILE
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
You will receive an error message describes that cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x` because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable x variable.
> It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value that’s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs. 
 
> If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do.

> The Rust compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t change, it really won’t change, so you don’t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus easier to reason through.
