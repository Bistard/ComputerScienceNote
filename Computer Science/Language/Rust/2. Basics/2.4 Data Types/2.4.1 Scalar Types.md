# Scalar Types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: 
1. integers, 
2. floating-point numbers, 
3. Booleans, 
4. and characters. 

You may recognize these from other programming languages. Let’s jump into how they work in Rust.

## Integer Types

An integer is a number without a fractional component. the `u32` type, this type declaration indicates that the value it is associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with `i` instead of `u`) that takes up 32 bits of space.

The following table shows the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare the type of an integer value:

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. *Signed* and *unsigned* refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be negative.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.

### Integer Literals
You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the following table:

| Number literals  | Example       |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |

> So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s defaults are generally good places to start: **integer types default to** `i32`.

> Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

### Integer Overflow
Let’s say you have a variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as 256, *integer overflow* will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.

When you are compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to `panic` at runtime if this behavior occurs (Rust uses the term *panicking* when a program exits with an error).

When you are compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs `two’s complement wrapping`.

## Floating-Point Types
Rust also has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. 

**The default type** is `f64` because on modern CPUs, it’s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. In additional, all the floating-point types are signed.

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the **IEEE-754** standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0;      // f64
    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

## Numeric Operations
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows how you’d use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:
```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

## Boolean Type
As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`. **Booleans are one byte in size**. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

## Character Type
Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are some examples of declaring `char` values:
```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```
Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.

Rust’s `char` type is **four bytes** in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.
