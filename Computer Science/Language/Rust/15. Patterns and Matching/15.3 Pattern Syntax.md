# Pattern Syntax

In this section, we gather all the syntax valid in patterns and discuss why and when you might want to use each one.

## Matching Literals

You can match patterns against literals directly. The following code gives some examples:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    match x {
        1 => println!("one"),
        2 => println!("two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
}
```

## Matching Named Variables

Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we’ve used them many times in the book. However, there is a complication when you use named variables in `match` expressions. Because `match` starts a new scope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the `match` expression will shadow those with the same name outside the `match` construct, as is the case with all variables:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;
    match x {
        Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
        Some(y) => println!("Matched, y = {y}"),
        _ => println!("Default case, x = {:?}", x),
    }
    println!("at the end: x = {:?}, y = {y}", x);
}
```

```txt
Matched, y = 5
at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10
```

* The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named `y` that will match any value inside a `Some` value. Because we’re in a new scope inside the `match` expression, this is a new `y` variable, not the `y` we declared at the beginning with the value 10.

## Multiple Patterns

In `match` expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the `|` syntax, which is the pattern ***or*** operator:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
}
```

## Matching Ranges of Values with `..=`

The `..=` syntax allows us to match to an **inclusive range** of values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```

* If `x` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match. This syntax is more convenient for multiple match values than using the `|` operator to express the same idea.

* The compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time, and because the only types for which Rust can tell if a range is empty or not are `char` and numeric values, ranges are only allowed with numeric or `char` values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 'c';
    match x {
        'a'..='j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),
        'k'..='z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```

# Destructuring to Break Apart Values

We can also use patterns to destructure structs, enums, and tuples to use different parts of these values. Let’s walk through each value.

## Destructuring Structs

```RUST
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, a);
    assert_eq!(7, b);
}
```

or

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    let Point { x, y } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, x);
    assert_eq!(7, y);
}
```

We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern rather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test some of the fields for particular values while creating variables to destructure the other fields:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {y}"),
        Point { x, y } => {
            println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})");
        }
    }
}
```

## Destructuring Enums

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => {
            println!("The Quit variant has no data to destructure.");
        }
        Message::Move { x, y } => {
            println!(
                "Move in the x direction {x} and in the y direction {y}"
            );
        }
        Message::Write(text) => {
            println!("Text message: {text}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!(
            "Change the color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}",
        ),
    }
}
```

## Destructuring Nested Structs and Enums

So far, our examples have all been matching structs or enums one level deep, but matching can work on nested items too!

```rust
enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));
    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {
            println!("Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => println!(
            "Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}"
        ),
        _ => (),
    }
}
```

## Destructuring Structs and Tuples

We can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways. The following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs and tuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:

```rust
let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
```

# Ignoring Values in a Pattern

You’ve seen that it’s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as in the last arm of a `match`, to get a catchall that doesn’t actually do anything but does account for all remaining possible values.

## Ignoring an Entire Value with `_`

We’ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but not bind to the value. This is especially useful as the last arm in a `match` expression, but we can also use it in any pattern, including function parameters:

```rust
fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("This code only uses the y parameter: {}", y);
}

fn main() {
    foo(3, 4);
}
```

## Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested `__`

We can also use `_` inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);
    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        }
        _ => {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }
    println!("setting is {:?}", setting_value);
}
```

We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore particular values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);
    match numbers {
        (first, _, third, _, fifth) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {third}, {fifth}")
        }
    }
}
```

```txt
Some numbers: 2, 8, 32
```

## Ignoring an Unused Variable by Starting its Name with `_`

If you create a variable but don’t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a warning because an unused variable could be a bug. However, sometimes it’s useful to be able to create a variable you won’t use yet, such as when you’re prototyping or just starting a project. In this situation, you can tell Rust not to warn you about the unused variable by starting the name of the variable with an underscore:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 5;
    let y = 10;
}
```

## Ignoring Remaining Parts of a Value With `..`

With values that have many parts, we can use the `..` syntax to use specific parts and ignore the rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each ignored value.

The `..` pattern ignores any parts of a value that we haven’t explicitly matched in the rest of the pattern:

```rust
fn main() {
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
        z: i32,
    }
    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
    match origin {
        Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {}", x),
    }
}
```

The syntax `..` will expand to as many values as it needs to be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);
    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {last}");
        }
    }
}
```

However, using `..` must be unambiguous. If it is unclear which values are intended for matching and which should be ignored, Rust will give us an error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);
    match numbers {
        (.., second, ..) => { // ❌ WON'T COMPILE
            println!("Some numbers: {}", second)
        },
    }
}
```

* It’s impossible for Rust to determine how many values in the tuple to ignore before matching a value with `second` and then how many further values to ignore thereafter.

# Extra Conditionals with Match Guards

A *match guard* is an additional `if` condition, specified after the pattern in a `match` arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = Some(4);
    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("The number {} is even", x),
        Some(x) => println!("The number {} is odd", x),
        None => (),
    }
}
```

* There is no way to express the `if x % 2 == 0` condition within a pattern, so the match guard gives us the ability to express this logic. 
* The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn't try to check for exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.

## `@` Bindings

The *at* operator `@` lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same time as we’re testing that value for a pattern match.

we want to test that a `Message::Hello` `id` field is within the range `3..=7`. We also want to bind the value to the variable `id_variable` so we can use it in the code associated with the arm. We could name this variable `id`, the same as the field, but for this example we’ll use a different name:

```rust
fn main() {
    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }
    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };
    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id_variable @ 3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range: {}", id_variable),
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range")
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {}", id),
    }
}
```

* Using `@` lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one pattern.

# Summary

Rust’s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of data. When used in `match` expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every possible value, or your program won’t compile. Patterns in `let` statements and function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables. We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.
