# Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match

Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. 

* Patterns that will match for any possible value passed are *irrefutable*. An example would be `x` in the statement `let x = 5;` because `x` matches anything and therefore cannot fail to match. 
* Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are *refutable*. An example would be `Some(x)` in the expression `if let Some(x) = a_value` because if the value in the `a_value` variable is `None` rather than `Some`, the `Some(x)` pattern will not match.

> Function parameters, `let` statements, and `for` loops can only accept irrefutable patterns, because the program cannot do anything meaningful when values don’t match.

> The `if let` and `while let` expressions accept refutable and irrefutable patterns, but the compiler warns against irrefutable patterns because by definition they’re intended to handle possible failure: the functionality of a conditional is in its ability to perform differently depending on success or failure.

In general, you shouldn’t have to worry about the distinction between refutable and irrefutable patterns; however, you do need to be familiar with the concept of refutability so you can respond when you see it in an error message. In those cases, you’ll need to change either the pattern or the construct you’re using the pattern with, depending on the intended behavior of the code.
