# Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators
> The reference [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-04-performance.html) that I took uses an example that demonstrate the iterator version of code was slightly faster then the `for` loop versions.
> As the original context explain: "We won’t explain the benchmark code here, because the point is not to prove that the two versions are equivalent but to get a general sense of how these two implementations compare performance-wise."

* The point is this: iterators, although a high-level abstraction, get compiled down to roughly the same code as if you’d written the lower-level code yourself.
* Iterators are one of Rust’s **zero-cost abstractions**, by which we mean using the abstraction imposes no additional runtime overhead.

> In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.

# Summary
Closures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming language ideas. They contribute to Rust’s capability to clearly express high-level ideas at low-level performance. The implementations of closures and iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of Rust’s goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.
