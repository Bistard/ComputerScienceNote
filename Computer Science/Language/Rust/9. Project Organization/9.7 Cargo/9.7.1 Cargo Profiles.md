# Customizing Builds with Release Profiles
In Rust, *cargo profiles* are predefined and customizable profiles with different configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over various options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently of the others.

* Cargo has two main profiles: 
  1. the `dev` profile Cargo uses when you run `cargo build`.
  2. the `release` profile Cargo uses when you run `cargo build --release`.

Cargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when you haven't explicitly added any `[profile.*]` sections in the project’s `Cargo.toml` file.
* By adding `[profile.*]` sections for any profile you want to customize, you override any subset of the default settings.

# Example - `opt-level`
For example, here are the default values for the `opt-level` setting for the `dev` and `release` profiles:
```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```
* The `opt-level` setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to your code, with a range of `0` to `3`. Applying more optimizations extends compiling time.

> so if you’re in development and compiling your code often, you’ll want fewer optimizations to compile faster even if the resulting code runs slower.

> You can override a default setting by adding a different value for it in `Cargo.toml`.
